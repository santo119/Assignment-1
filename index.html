                    <p>It's important to distinguish HTML from programming languages. HTML itself doesn't perform <br>

                    <p>CSS, which stands for Cascading Style Sheets, is the language that defines the presentation of a

                        web page created with HTML. While HTML provides the structure and content, CSS controls the <br>
                        visual appearance, layout, and behavior.
